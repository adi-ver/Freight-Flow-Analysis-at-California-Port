# Freight-Flow-Analysis-at-California-Port

## Methodology
- Data Integration: Data from multiple sources were collected and unified into a single dataset.
- Data Transformation: Features were converted into suitable units and normalized as necessary.
- Visualization: Line plots and visualizations were generated to identify trends.
- Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix and heatmap were created to explore relationships between variables.
- Regression Modeling: A regression model was built, yielding a high R-squared value and statistically significant parameters.

## Key Findings
1) Significant correlations were identified between freight flow, global oil production, and the USA's GDP.
2) An interesting trend was observed where increases in oil production are consistently followed by rises in freight flow by a few years.This can be effectively explained by the Trade Theory. It states that, In classical and neoclassical trade models, the production of goods (which requires energy inputs like oil) often precedes trade. Therefore, an increase in oil production can be a precursor to increased manufacturing and trade flows.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the integration of diverse datasets and the application of statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights. The findings have implications for understanding economic and logistical patterns, particularly in relation to global oil production and freight flow dynamics.
